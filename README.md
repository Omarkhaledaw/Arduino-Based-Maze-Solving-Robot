# Arduino-Based-Maze-Solving-Robot
I was the leader in the group project that involves using Arduino uno to turn a 4 wheeled robot into a maze-solver robot that uses 3 ultrasonic sensors to determine if there's an obstacle on left, right or front of it. The original robot uses 4 DC motors to move and with the help of L293D (H-bridge) We were able to properly control each motor.
Aside from leading the group members, my main role was programming and creating the code structure of the project using Arduino IDE.
